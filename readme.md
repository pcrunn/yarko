# yarko

> yarko is the simplest version control system. because it's not a version control system.

yarko doesn't track files or commits, doesn't care what you have in your repository, it just cares that your files can be uploaded/downloaded from a server of your choice, and that's why it's so simple.

And did i mention it's written in bash? that makes yarko portable, lightweight, and easily updateable.

yarko is not done and it should not be used, it will most likely get discontinued one day.
